uOFW
====

The unofficial Official FirmWare, a complete latest PSP firmware reverse engineering project.  
Project page: http://uofw.psnpt.com/  
Doxygen documentation: http://uofw.psnpt.com/sdkdoc/  
For more information: http://dev.psnpt.com/redmine/projects/uofw/wiki  

Getting started
---------------

In order to contribute to uOFW, you need advanced knowledge in MIPS ASM and C. Some good MIPS ASM  
online resources can be found at: 
http://www.mips.com/products/product-materials/processor/mips-architecture/  
MIPS ASM Instruction Set Reference: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/mips-iv.pdf  

In addition, there is a nice MIPS runtime simulator and debugger which can be found at:  
http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/

The next step is to improve your reverse engineering skills (if needed). We suggest reading the  
following excellent guide about reverse engineering for the PSP:

Additional Information
----------------------

While you reverse-engineer parts of the PSP's kernel, you may will find yourself in a position
where you would like to know more about how Operating Systems work in general. We suggest to check
out the following webpage: http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page
