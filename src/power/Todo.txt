- scePowerSetGeEdramRefreshMode(): Look at the used arithmetic (compiler) optimization again and try to re-weite it into a more readable form

- scePowerSetPowerSwMode() / scePowerGetPowerSwMode(): Introduce macros (or a typedef'd struct) for the power switch mode:
#define SCE_POWER_SWITCH_MODE_HARDWARE_POWER_SWITCH_REQUESTS_CALLBACK_SUPPORTED (0)
#define SCE_POWER_SWITCH_MODE_HARDWARE_POWER_SWITCH_REQUESTS_SUPPORTED			(1)

in battery.c: Define macros for event flag values.
